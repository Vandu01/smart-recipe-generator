# 🍽️ Smart Recipe Generator  
_A simple yet powerful web application that recommends recipes based on the ingredients you have._

---

## 📌 Overview

Smart Recipe Generator is a full-stack project designed to help users quickly find recipes they can cook using the ingredients available at home.  
Instead of browsing hundreds of recipes online, you simply enter a few ingredients — and the system intelligently filters, matches, and suggests recipes.

This project includes:
- A clean and responsive frontend UI  
- A Node.js + Express backend  
- Ingredient-based recipe matching  
- Recipe creation feature (Add Recipe)  
- Smart filter system

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔍 Ingredient-Based Search  
Users can type multiple ingredients (comma separated) and instantly see recipes that use those ingredients.

### 🧠 Smart Matching Engine  
The backend compares user-provided ingredients with stored recipes and ranks them based on:
- Number of matching ingredients  
- Missing ingredient count  
- Relevance score  

### ➕ Add New Recipes  
Through **AddRecipe.jsx**, users can add:
- Recipe Name  
- List of Ingredients  
- Instructions / Steps  

The data is stored in the backend database.

### 🎨 Clean UI + Smooth Workflow  
The homepage displays your search bar and recipe list in a neat layout.  
The Add Recipe page provides a simple form to create new recipes easily.
